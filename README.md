# Japan Hoops :basketball:
When I first moved to Japan from Hawaii, I had trouble finding public basketball courts to play on. This is an app to map public basketball courts in Japan. Users can create accounts and contribute by adding courts to the map. The map is generated from react-leaflet. I used Redux for state management and it is connected to the Geolocation API to center the map on the users' current location. Firebase handles the authentication and storage of data in FireStore.
